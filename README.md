# assettoCorsaLaptimeViewer

You can access the site at https://ben-robertson.com/assettoCorsaLaptimeViewer/ and upload your session file[^1]
Alternatively just download the repo, open `index.html` in your browser, then upload a session file[^1].

It may be worth ordering your files by "name" or "date modified" - descending so that your latest sessions appear at the top.

This works with single player games started from **Content Manager** as your player is always stored as the first.

[^1]: Session files are stored as JSON files and can be found in your `\AppData\Local\AcTools Content Manager\Progress\Sessions` folder.
